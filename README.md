# Quantum Hackathon 2022

## Toward solving large combinational optimization problem

## Existing solutions for maxcut
1. QAOA in QAOA
2. DC-QAOA

Our contributions is that implementing DC-QAOA with Qiskit referencing repository [DC-QAOA](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Quantum/blob/master/tutorials/combinatorial_optimization/DC-QAOA_CN.ipynb) which implemented by PaddlePaddle

## Proposed Method

We try to approximate the unitary matrix with two smaller matrixs' tensor product and test the idea for maxcut problem and molecule simulations.
